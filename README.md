# Electronics_Self_Balancing_Segway
Applying the theory learnt from two Electrical Engineering modules, our group achieved a self-balancing two wheeled robot, whose movements could be controlled remotely.   For this project we were given the robot, we had to implement Python code onto the Pyboard computer. The Pyboardâ€™s electrical modules included an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a microphone.
