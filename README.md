# Electronics_Self_Balancing_Segway
Applying the theory learnt from two Electrical Engineering modules, our group achieved a self-balancing two wheeled robot, whose movements could be controlled remotely.   For this project we were given the robot, we had to implement Python code onto the Pyboard computer. The Pyboardâ€™s electrical modules included an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a microphone. 

In the "Self Balancing Segway Code Use" folder, are the stages of code written and edited to achieve segway control. 

**Using the Stabilisers**
Milestone 1: Controlling the motors using bluetooth and Adafruit's remote control app. 
Milestone 2: Using the pyboard's microphone to detect musical beats, when a beat was detected a built in LED would flash on the Pyboard.
Milestone 3: For each beat detected, the segway would perform a 'dancemove', a coded instruction to the wheel motors.

**No more stabilisers**
Milestone 4: Using PID control system to achieve a balanced segway, that remain balanced despite disturbances.
Milestone 5: Balanced segway, that could be controlled by the Adafruit remote control app. 

Milestone 6: (not fully achieved) Balancing segway, that detects musical beats and dances!!
